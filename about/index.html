                <p class="text-left">“If only we could show people abroad what our guys are capable of!” passionately agreed Marko and Stanko.</p> 
                <p class="text-left">It was a rainy Friday in Belgrade, Serbia, the one that the longtime friends had set aside for a long-awaited homecoming.</p>
                <p class="text-left">They recollected their travels and the many years spent working as consultants, entrepreneurs and salespeople, all around Serbia and the ex-Yugoslavia countries. They had learned the same lesson: wasted opportunity was everywhere!</p>
                <p class="text-left">And indeed, both had ended up in truly remarkable places. They got to feel the tools used by generations of skilled craftsmen in small artisan shops. They smelled the freshest produce in interminable fertile fields. They tasted Americano with visionary web entrepreneurs, or amazing rakia (Serbian brandy) with the families that made it just like their grandfathers used to. They saw busy workshops where engineers and workers make sturdy, durable mechanical components. But while these businesses had some real magic going on, all of them were struggling to get the attention of international markets. Why?</p>
                <p class="text-left">The problem is a mix of underdeveloped business environments, lack of government support, and poor marketing knowledge. “If only we could show people abroad what our guys are capable of.” This was towards the end of 2014 - the night when Marko and Stanko conceived the idea of All from Serbia and Region: the one venue where all the excellence of their home could be collected and spread to the world.</p>
                <p class="text-left">Within a few months, Stanko and Marko had joined forces by founding ConsultUs, the company that would make the dream come to life. And here we are now, connecting people and nurturing those hidden opportunities that deserve their five minutes under the spotlight.</p></div>
